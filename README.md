## This fork: GitHub Pages

[Open Flashback RAW Editor](https://nikunjsingh93.github.io/flashback-raw-editor-web/)

### Apply one film look to a roll and download ZIP

Open several photos, choose a film (for example Disposable), then tap **Apply look to all** below the preview. This copies the current film look and adjustments while keeping each photo's crop, rotation and Auto WB. Tap **Download ZIP** to develop every included photo and save one archive of processed JPEGs (or TIFFs, selected in Settings or by long-pressing Download ZIP). Excluded photos stay out of the archive. All processing stays on your device.

This independent fork retains the upstream GPL-3.0 license and credits.
Changes adapt asset URLs, the install manifest and offline worker to a GitHub Pages repository subfolder. Worker cleanup is restricted to this app so other Pages apps retain their offline caches.

Pushes to main build and publish dist through GitHub Actions. For a matching local build: set VITE_BASE_PATH=/flashback-raw-editor-web/ and run npm run build.

Android requires a browser/device with WebGPU. Load the app and use each film look while online before relying on offline operation.

<h1 align="center">Flashback RAW Editor (Web / PWA)</h1>

A self-contained, installable web app that develops **Flashback One35 v2** DNG/RAW
files entirely **on the device** — no server, no account, no network after install.
It's a browser port of the original [flashback-raw-editor](https://github.com/lofilogic/flashback-raw-editor)
(Python + PySide6 + WebGPU), rebuilt as a Progressive Web App so it runs from a URL
and installs to the iPhone Home Screen.

> **Requirements:** iOS 26+ / Safari 26+, or Android with Chrome 121+ (both need
> WebGPU — there is no CPU fallback, the whole pipeline runs on the GPU). Desktop
> Chrome/Edge with WebGPU also works for development. The iPhone install flow
> below is the most tested path; Android should work the same way via Chrome's
> "Add to Home screen," though getting DNGs onto an Android device from the
> camera hasn't been verified the way the iPhone Files-app flow has.

> **Desktop Chrome/Edge: "WebGPU unavailable"?** WebGPU needs the browser's GPU
> backend, which is off when **hardware acceleration is disabled**. Turn it on at
> **Settings → System → "Use hardware acceleration when available"**, then relaunch
> the browser. You can confirm the GPU backend is active at `chrome://gpu` (the
> **WebGPU** line should read *"Hardware accelerated"*). Firefox/Floorp pick a GPU
> differently and may work even when Chrome doesn't — but the fix is the Chrome
> setting, not the browser.

Eight film looks — colour-calibrated 3D LUTs (or procedural grades for Gold and
Expired Superia) with per-look grain, halation, vignette, and chromatic aberration
character, all rendered live on the GPU from the same RAW file.

## Why a web app

- The original already uses **WebGPU + WGSL** compute shaders, and WebGPU is a web
  standard — the shaders port to the browser largely unchanged.
- One35 DNGs are decoded by a small **pure-JS** decoder calibrated to match the desktop;
  **libraw-wasm** is the fallback for other RAW files.
- No App Store, Xcode, or Swift — distribute a URL, install via "Add to Home Screen."

## Privacy

Your photos never leave the device. The host only ever serves the static app files
(HTML/JS/WASM/LUTs/icons). All decoding, colour processing, film effects, and export
happen locally on the phone's GPU. Once installed, the service worker serves the app
offline and it stops contacting the host entirely.

## Features

**Real film looks, rendered live on your own GPU** — the same colour pipeline as the
desktop app (sensor CCM → ACEScct → 3D LUT → effects), running entirely in the browser.
No upload, no waiting on a server, no account.

### Eight film looks, infinitely tunable
Natural, Disposable, Point & Shoot, Rangefinder, Monochrome, and Flashback V1 — each
a colour-calibrated LUT with its own grain, halation, and vignette character — plus
procedural **Gold** and **Expired Superia** grades with no `.cube` file needed. Dial in
your own and save it as a one-tap preset.

### Bring your own LUTs — and share looks
Import any `.cube` file; ordinary sRGB / Rec.709 photo LUTs are colour-managed into the
pipeline automatically, so they just work. **Export a look** to a small file (with its
custom LUT bundled in) to share, and **import** looks others send you — all from
Settings → Share Looks.

### Live, GPU-rendered effects
Grain, three-scale halation, chromatic aberration, softness, sharpen, vignette, and
bloom — all running in real time as you drag a slider, not baked in after the fact.

### Shoot a whole roll, edit every frame independently
Open dozens of DNGs at once. Every thumbnail in the strip remembers **its own** profile,
adjustments, crop, and rotation — switch between photos and nothing resets. **Copy** a
look from one frame and **Apply** it to another, to several (multi-select), or to the
whole roll. Exclude or remove photos in bulk, then export only the ones you want.

### Edit like it's the real darkroom
Exposure, white balance, tint, and push/pull. Crop and straighten (±45°) with aspect
presets and auto cover-scaling. Date and frame-number stamps styled like a 2000s camera's
date-back. A histogram, before/after compare (just press and hold), pinch-to-zoom that
stays in the photo, rotate, and a distraction-free zen mode.

### Open more than DNG
Since 1.3.0: other RAW formats (CR2/CR3, NEF, ARW, RAF, RW2, ORF and more) and JPEG/PNG
import too, with the full looks & effects applied — experimental, since the looks are
calibrated for the One35 sensor. A per-photo **Auto WB** effect develops with each file's
own camera white balance (off by default — a daylight-balanced feel is part of the analog
look). Plus per-photo **undo/redo**, **clipping warnings** on the histogram, and a
**photo info** sheet (tap the filename).

### Export, or just install it and forget it
JPEG (8-bit) or 16-bit TIFF. **Full-resolution export** is an opt-in setting — on iPhone
it renders in tiles to stay within iOS memory (a little slower, same full-res result).
The app tells you when an update is ready, and shows a "What's new" summary after each
one. Install it once and it runs **fully offline** forever after — your photos never
leave the device, period.

## Install on iPhone

1. Open the deployed URL in **Safari** (iOS 26+).
2. **Share → Add to Home Screen.**
3. While online, tap each vibe once so its LUT caches. After that it runs fully offline.

Getting DNGs onto the phone: connect the Flashback One35 v2 via USB-C, copy DNGs into
the Files app (or iCloud Drive), then use **Open** in the app. (iOS Safari can't talk to
the camera over USB directly — WebUSB isn't supported there.)

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173 (Chrome/Edge with WebGPU)
npm run build      # → dist/ (static files)
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
```

Notes:
- No COOP/COEP headers in dev or production: the libraw worker runs as a plain Web
  Worker (no SharedArrayBuffer), and COOP breaks iOS standalone PWA launch.
- `vite.config.js` excludes `libraw-wasm` from dep-optimization (its internal worker +
  wasm URLs must resolve relative to the package) and injects a build stamp (`__BUILD_ID__`)
  shown on the front page so you can confirm a deploy synced.
- `libraw-wasm` is **pinned to 1.1.2 on purpose** — the colour calibration (e.g.
  `LIBRAW_PREMUL`, the per-channel decode corrections) was measured against this exact
  version's output. Upgrading changes decode results and breaks the desktop colour match;
  re-calibrate against reference exports before ever bumping it.

## Deploy

`npm run build` emits a fully static `dist/` (~29 MB, LUTs dominate). Host it on any
static host with HTTPS — HTTPS is required for WebGPU and PWA install.

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

The easiest path — no terminal, no Node.js, no git knowledge required:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/deknared/flashback-raw-editor-web)

**What clicking this button actually does**, step by step:
1. You're sent to Cloudflare and asked to log in (or create a free account if you
   don't have one).
2. Cloudflare asks you to authorize access to your GitHub account, then it **forks
   this repository into your own GitHub account** — you end up owning a full copy
   of the source, not just a deployed instance.
3. Cloudflare reads `wrangler.jsonc` from the fork, runs `npm install` and
   `npm run build` for you, and deploys the resulting `dist/` as your own Worker.
4. You get your own URL — something like
   `https://flashback-raw-editor-web.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev` — completely
   independent of the original deployment. Nothing you do on your copy affects
   anyone else's.
5. From then on, any commit you push to *your* forked repo's `main` branch can be
   redeployed the same way (or set up for auto-deploy from the Cloudflare dashboard
   under your Worker's Settings → Builds).

This is the right option if you want your own independent copy without touching a
terminal. If you're comfortable with the command line and want more control (custom
naming before the first deploy, etc.), use the manual steps below instead — they do
the same thing without the GitHub fork.

#### Manual deploy

This repo is set up for [Cloudflare Workers Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/)
via `wrangler.jsonc` — no Worker code, just a static-asset deploy.

```bash
npm install -g wrangler        # or use npx wrangler below without a global install
npx wrangler login             # opens a browser to authorize with your Cloudflare account
npm run build                  # → dist/
npx wrangler deploy            # publishes dist/ per wrangler.jsonc
```

- The first deploy creates a Worker named `flashback-raw-editor-web` (from `wrangler.jsonc`'s
  `name` field) and gives you a URL like `https://flashback-raw-editor-web.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
  Edit `name` in `wrangler.jsonc` before the first deploy if you want a different name —
  it becomes part of the URL and is harder to change later.
- Re-running `npx wrangler deploy` after any `npm run build` redeploys the updated `dist/`.
- A **custom domain** can be attached afterwards from the Cloudflare dashboard
  (Workers & Pages → your Worker → Settings → Domains & Routes).
- Workers Assets reads `public/_headers` for the COOP/COEP + wasm MIME headers
  libraw-wasm needs.

### Deploying elsewhere

Any static host with HTTPS works (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages with a
custom domain, etc.) — just serve `dist/` and make sure `public/_headers` (or your
host's equivalent) is honored for the WASM content-type header.

The service worker is **network-first for navigations** (so redeploys aren't served
stale) and **cache-first for content-hashed assets**. Bump `CACHE_NAME` in `public/sw.js`
when changing the precache list so clients pick up the new shell.

## Architecture

```
index.html              App shell + UI
public/
  manifest.json         PWA manifest (PNG + SVG icons)
  sw.js                 Service worker (offline cache)
  _headers              COOP/COEP + wasm MIME (Netlify)
  icons/                icon.svg + rasterized PNGs (180/192/512)
  assets/luts/*.cube    Film LUTs
  assets/grain/*.png    Four grain tiles (packed into a 2×2 atlas at load)
src/
  main.js               App entry: UI wiring, state, export, gestures, persistence
  core/
    gpu.js              WebGPU device + compute helpers (2D dispatch for big images)
    processor.js        Pipeline: decode → ACEScct intermediate → render/export
    raw-decoder.js      Decoder router: pure-JS One35 path + libraw-wasm fallback
    one35-dng.js        Pure-JS One35 Bayer decoder (half-size + full-size demosaic)
    effects.js          GPU film-effect orchestrator (live chain + baked passes)
    lut.js              3D LUT upload (+ sRGB/Rec.709 input bridge for imports)
    procedural-luts.js  JS-generated LUTs (Gold, Expired Superia)
    profile-io.js       Export / import a shareable look (.json, LUT bundled in)
    config.js           CCM/WB constants, vibe presets, defaults
    vibe-state.js       localStorage persistence (per-vibe + session)
  ui/
    sliders.js          Touch scrub sliders
    export.js           JPEG (sRGB Exif) + 16-bit TIFF encoders
    style.css            Mobile-first theme (dark + light mode)
  shaders/*.wgsl        Compute shaders (colour pipeline + effects)
```

The ACEScct intermediate is kept resident on the GPU so slider changes only re-run the
cheap preview passes. Previews render downscaled during a drag, then full (preview-size)
on release. Spatial effects are scaled by the resolution ratio at export so a full-res
file matches what the preview showed. A small per-photo render cache makes switching
between already-viewed photos in the strip instant.

## Changelog

### 1.3.4

**Health-audit cleanup** — removed dead code (an orphaned highlight-desaturation shader and
unused pipeline entry points; slightly smaller bundle), aligned the dev server's headers with
production (no COOP/COEP anywhere — the libraw worker doesn't need SharedArrayBuffer), bumped
the build's Node version off EOL 20 to 22 LTS, documented the deliberate `libraw-wasm` 1.1.2
pin, and fixed stale README claims (iPhone full-resolution export has worked since 1.3.0).
No rendering changes.

### 1.3.3

**Matching crop ratios** — the crop tool was missing 16:9, and the Settings → Default Crop
picker offered a different set of ratios. Both now share the same options: 1:1, 4:3, 3:4,
3:2, 2:3, and 16:9.

### 1.3.2

**Vignette follows your crop** — the vignette used to be rendered on the full sensor frame,
so cropping or straightening cut a window out of an already-vignetted image and the falloff
stayed centred on the original frame (thanks for the report!). The vignette's radial field is
now mapped through the crop + straighten transform, so it centres on the final frame you see —
in the preview, JPEG, and TIFF alike. (Chromatic aberration intentionally stays frame-centred:
it models the physical lens, which doesn't move when you crop.)

### 1.3.1

**Daylight-balanced foreign RAW** — generic (non-One35) raws now develop at the camera's
*daylight* white balance (libraw's `pre_mul`), nudged from D65 to `BASE_KELVIN` (5500 K) so
they land at Flashback's neutral — matching the desktop's daylight philosophy instead of the
as-shot/auto WB. Import is also much faster: the preview uses the fast linear demosaic, with
high-quality AHD only at full-res export. Still experimental.

**Auto WB off by default** — a daylight feel is part of the analog look, so One35 photos start
with their fixed calibrated balance. A one-time migration turns it off for existing users too;
flip it on per photo, or change the default in Settings.

**Smoother photo switching** — a render generation token discards renders and preview-cache
writes that started for the previous photo, fixing the grey/black flashes and back-and-forth
when switching (especially with a profile change or rotation just after).

**Tidier Undo/Redo** — they sit on the filename row when a single photo is open, and on the
look-tools row beside Copy/Select with two or more.

### 1.3.0

**Open more than DNG** — import other RAW formats (CR2/CR3, NEF, ARW, RAF, RW2, ORF and
more) and JPEG/PNG, with the full looks & effects applied. Both paths are experimental:
the looks are calibrated for the One35 sensor, so colour/exposure on non-One35 files are
best-effort (foreign RAW uses a faithful port of the desktop's per-make exposure
anchoring; an **EXP** tag marks non-One35 files).

**Auto WB** — a per-photo effect (on by default, with a global default in Settings) that
develops each photo with its own as-shot camera white balance, so warm/cool scenes
self-correct. Toggle it off per photo to keep the as-shot balance.

**Full-resolution export on iPhone** — true full-res output now works on iOS via tiled
rendering, which bounds peak GPU memory so the tab no longer crashes. Halation and bloom
are computed as global low-res pre-passes; the result is pixel-identical to the
single-pass desktop render.

**Undo / redo** — per-photo edit history covering adjustments, effects, and profile
changes, on the look-tools row.

**Clipping warnings** — a toggle alongside the histogram paints blown highlights red and
crushed shadows blue on the preview.

**Photo info** — tap the filename for a metadata sheet (camera, exposure, ISO, etc.).

**Cleaner full-res detail** — an edge-directed (Hamilton–Adams) demosaic reduces the
zipper/fringe artifacts on fine detail in full-resolution exports, while staying
mean-preserving so the export still matches the preview.

**Halation warmth** — a second Halation slider tunes how warm the highlight glow reddens.
Plus: browse the filmstrip while full screen, a clearer "enable WebGPU" screen when it's
unavailable, and the Disposable softness tuned to match the desktop app.

### 1.2.1

**Halation parity fix** — the halation highlight threshold is now measured against
the scene exposure (matching the desktop app), instead of the internally-lifted
signal. Previously the +2 EV base lift made the 4.5-EV threshold behave like ~2.5 EV,
so halation bloomed from too many highlights; it's now correct and exposure-invariant.

### 1.2.0

**Export fixes** — JPEG/TIFF export now works on desktop and Android (previously a
WebGPU storage-buffer limit produced black files, and the share sheet had no
"save to disk"). Desktop/Android download; iPhone uses the share sheet.

**Full-resolution export** — opt-in toggle in Settings (off by default), powered by a
new full-size pure-JS One35 decoder so a full-res file matches the preview exactly.
iPhone exports at an optimized size to stay within iOS memory.

**Share looks** — export your current look to a small file (custom LUT bundled in) and
import looks others share, from Settings → Share Looks.

**Imported LUTs colour-managed** — ordinary sRGB / Rec.709 photo LUTs are bridged into
the pipeline automatically, so they look right with no extra steps.

**Copy a look across photos** — Copy arms the current look (its source is outlined);
Apply / Apply all / multi-select Apply spread it across the roll. Plus batch
exclude/include and remove from the filmstrip.

**Halation rebuilt** to match desktop 1.6.5 — a three-scale glow that reddens outward,
with a warmth control.

**Auto date stamp** from each photo's file date (One35 DNGs record no capture date),
with a manual override.

**Updates** — an "update available" banner when a new version is ready, a "What's new"
patch-notes sheet (main menu + Settings), and the app version in Settings.

**UX** — pinch-to-zoom stays within the photo (no accidental fullscreen), straighten
extended to ±45°, default-crop setting applied on open, filmstrip padding, and a clearer
"WebGPU unavailable" message (enable hardware acceleration in desktop Chrome/Edge).

### 1.1.0

**New film look: Expired Superia** — procedural grade with a strong teal/cyan cast,
warm-highlight/cool-shadow split, vivid reds. Factory defaults: grain 1.5, sharpen 1.45,
vignette 0.45, push −1.

**Optical effects rewrite**
- Bloom: 4× pyramid downsample/upsample
- Halation: two-pass screen blend, sigmoid gate in ACEScct space
- Chromatic aberration: spectral 8-sample reciprocal-magnification shader
- Highlight recovery in raw WB space (pre-matrix)

**Settings page** — export format (JPEG / TIFF 16-bit), JPEG quality, batch format, date
and frame stamps with colour options, profile order (drag to reorder), light/dark theme,
reduce motion, full-res iOS export, and reset buttons.

**UX polish**
- Long-press Export or Batch Export to pick a format for that one export without changing settings
- Push and Saturation bypass toggles in the Effects strip (dot indicator)
- Tapping an effect button opens its slider; long-press toggles the effect on/off
- Sharpen ↺ reset now correctly targets the loaded preset's default value
- Effects panel redesigned: above action bar, all-corner radius, proper padding
- Gold highlight blowout fixed (highlight desaturation curve)
- Finer grain tile scale across all looks
- Auto-WB removed from UI

### 1.0.0 — Initial release

The first public release of the web port. Brings the original desktop app's film
pipeline to a self-contained, installable PWA with the full feature set described
above: GPU colour pipeline matched to the desktop reference, the full set of film
vibes and live effects, per-photo editing across a multi-DNG photo strip with
configurable batch export, crop/straighten, date/frame stamps, custom presets and
LUT import, and an offline-first installable PWA shell.
